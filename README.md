# Create a Model to Classify Cats and Dogs and Save Best Model to reuse in Future.

## Specific Concept that will be covered.

In this process, I'll build practical experience and develop intution around the following concept

- Building data input pipelines using the `tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class. How can I efficiently work with data on disk to interface with our model?
- Overfitting - what is it?, how to identify it, and how can we prevent it?
- Data Augmentation and Dropout - key techniques to fight overfitting in computer vision tasks that I'll incorporate into data pipeline and image classifier model.

## I'll follow the general machine learning workflow.

1. Examine and understand data
2. Buid an input pipeline
3. Buil my model
4. Train my model
5. Test my model
6. Improve my model/Repeat the process
7. Save my best model
